# GPO Search Tool

A fast, client-side search tool for browsing and searching Group Policy Object (GPO) HTML exports generated by GPMC (Group Policy Management Console).

## Features

- **Full-text search** across all loaded GPO exports — search by keywords, policy names, registry paths, and more
- **Exact phrase search** — use quotes for precise matching (e.g. `"edge blocklist"`)
- **Quick filter chips** — automatically detected categories (BitLocker, Chrome, Firewall, Registry, etc.) let you narrow results with one click
- **Section context** — each search result shows a breadcrumb path indicating *where* in the GPO the match was found (e.g. `User Configuration > Policies > Administrative Templates > Google Chrome`)
- **Smart detail view** — click any search result to open the GPO report with all sections expanded, search terms highlighted, and auto-scrolled to the first match
- **Regex support** — toggle regex mode for advanced pattern matching
- **Case sensitivity** — toggle case-sensitive search on or off
- **Live search** — results update as you type, with debounced input
- **Pagination** — handles thousands of GPO files without performance issues

## Privacy & Data Handling

**All data stays in your browser.** When you load a folder of GPO exports, the files are read and processed entirely client-side using the browser's File API and DOMParser. No data is uploaded, stored on a server, or sent anywhere. Closing the tab clears everything.

## How to Use

### 1. Export GPOs as HTML

Run this PowerShell command on a domain controller or management workstation with the GroupPolicy module installed:

```powershell
mkdir C:\GPO-Export -Force; Get-GPO -All | %{Get-GPOReport -Guid $_.Id -ReportType Html -Path "C:\GPO-Export\$($_.DisplayName -replace '[\\/:*?"<>|]','_').html"}
```

This exports every GPO in your domain as an individual HTML file.

### 2. Open the tool

Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox). No web server needed — it runs as a single local HTML file.

### 3. Load your GPO exports

Click **"Map laden"** and select the folder containing your exported HTML files. The tool will parse all files and build a searchable index.

### 4. Search and filter

- Type keywords in the search bar (e.g. `BitLocker`, `HKEY_LOCAL`, `USB`)
- Use `"quotes"` for exact phrase matching (e.g. `"edge blocklist"`)
- Multiple terms without quotes use AND logic — all words must be present
- Use the filter chips that appear below the toolbar to narrow by category
- Toggle `.*` for regex mode or `Aa` for case-sensitive search
- Click any result card to view the GPO report with matches highlighted

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari)
- GPO HTML exports from GPMC (`Get-GPOReport -ReportType Html`)
